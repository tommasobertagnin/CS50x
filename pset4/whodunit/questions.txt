1.  `stdint.h` is a standard C library that contains a set of `typedef` with a fixed size in bytes
2.  using the types defined in `stdint.h` ensures that variables have the correct byte size
3.  BYTE has 8 bytes, DWORD has 32 bytes, LONG has 32 bytes, and WORD has 16 bytes
4.  BM
5.  bfSize is the file size, biSize it is the header size
6.  that the scanlines are flipped top-to-bottom
7.  biBitCount
8.  for some reason the file could not be opened therefore `fopen` returns `NULL`
9.  1 defines how many times the read operation is repeated
10. 4
11. fseek reads from a file and sets an offset to its content
12. SEEK_CUR is the current position of the file pointer (it's not clear to me where this is stored though..)
